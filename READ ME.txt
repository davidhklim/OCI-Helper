I also create an OCI Tracker that I found useful in helping me keep organized through the process.

Description:  
This tool automates the creation of personalized cover letters using firm-specific data. It is based on the official Peter A. Allard School of Law Cover Letter and Resume template. *Important:* Your cover letter header and resume header should match.

Usage Instructions:  
(1) Update the Template:  
   - Edit your cover letter template as needed.  
   - Use the official Peter A. Allard School of Law template.  
   - Copy and paste the required placeholder fields (e.g., «Short_Name») exactly as shown.

(2) Run the Executable:  
   - Double-click the executable file to launch the Cover Letter Generator.  
   - When prompted, select your updated Word template.

(3) Generate PDFs:  
   - The program reads firm information from the accompanying Excel file.  
   - It generates personalized cover letters and outputs them as PDF files.  
   - The PDFs are organized into separate folders for each group of firm information.

The FirmSearch.exe program lets you quickly look up addresses and Student Hiring Managers for the firms listed in Firm_List.xlsx. 

(1) It will first prompt you to choose between Toronto and Vancouver. 

(2) The program opens a browser tab for each selected firm (Firm_List.xlsx) for the selected city so you can verify the address from the Excel file. 

(3) Next, it will ask if you wish to search for the Student Hiring Manager; if you click 'Yes', it opens additional tabs searching for each firm along with "Student Hiring Manager."

Enjoy automating your cover letter creation!
