The **FirmSearch.exe** program lets you quickly look up addresses and Student Hiring Managers for the firms listed in Firm_List.xlsx. 

(1) It will first prompt you to choose between Toronto and Vancouver. 

(2) The program opens a browser tab for each selected firm (Firm_List.xlsx) for the selected city so you can verify the address from the Excel file. 

(3) Next, it will ask if you wish to search for the Student Hiring Manager; if you click 'Yes', it opens additional tabs searching for each firm along with "Student Hiring Manager."
